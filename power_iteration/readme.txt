See 'power_iteration.py' for details. It provides an efficient way of finding the largest singular value which is used to enforce the libschitz constraint of w-gans. This is a lot faster than computing an entire SVD. See 'test_speed.py' for experimentation with different implementations, a plot is also available in 'test_speed.pdf'. It seems for now there is a problem in the tensorflow implementation, so for now we use the numpy one, the test code is biased against the tf implementations as the matrices we test on live in RAM while when training w-gan they live on GPU.
